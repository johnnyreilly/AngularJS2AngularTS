<h3>Our Prayer</h3>

<p>Our life of prayer falls into three natural parts. These are:</p>

<p>The Prayer of the Church, which is sometimes called the Divine Office and which punctuates our day with hymns, psalms and spiritual canticles, as St Paul recommended.</p>

<p>Our personal prayer time alone with God. There are two hours set aside for this each day though our hope is that our whole day can be filled with prayer.</p>

<p>Our specific intercession for the needs of the Church, of our friends and those who contact us asking us to support them with our prayer. This takes place specifically at Morning and Evening Prayer and at many private moments throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Our usual timetable</h3>

<ul>
    <li>5.00 	Rise</li>
    <li>5.45 	Readings – a morning invitation to prayer composed of some psalms and two readings, one from Scripture and one from a Christian teacher or saint. These nourish our spirits for the day ahead. A quick breakfast followed by time for personal prayer, reading, study until 7.30</li>
    <li>7.30 	Morning Prayer, the Prayer of Praise to God followed by Spiritual reading.</li>
    <li>8.30 	Holy Mass followed by a short Office and then work until 11.50</li>
    <li>11.50 	A short Prayer written by Francis of Assisi followed by Scripture reading</li>
    <li>12.30 	Dinner; some free time until 2.15</li>
    <li>2.15 	back to work with a tea break at 3.30 and a short prayer together in the refectory at 4.00 to sanctify our work</li>
    <li>5.50 	Evening Prayer</li>
    <li>6.30 	Supper followed by an hour of personal prayer time until 8.15</li>
    <li>8.15 	Compline or Night Prayer, which closes the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wednesday evening and Thursday morning there is no Office celebrated in public, the sisters have a ‘hermit’ space, each praying alone.</p>
